## Introduction

Agriculture is a vital part of our economy, and making informed decisions regarding crop selection is crucial for farmers. This project addresses this challenge by using Machine Learning to predict the most suitable crops based on various parameters such as soil type, temperature, humidity, and more. The React-based GUI makes it easy for users to input their data and obtain predictions.

## Features

- **Crop Prediction Model**: The core of this project is a robust Machine Learning model that predicts suitable crops based on input data.
- **User-friendly GUI**: The React-based GUI provides an intuitive interface for users to input data and receive crop predictions.
- **Customization**: The model can be customized and extended with additional data and features.
- **Scalability**: The GUI can be easily extended and adapted to include more features and data sources.

## Installation

To run the Crop Prediction model and GUI locally, follow these steps:

   1.Clone the repository to your local machine:

   
   ```git clone https://github.com/RAJPOWELL/Crop.git```
   
   2.Navigate to the project directory:
   ```cd crop```
   
   3.Install the required dependencies for both the backend (Machine Learning model) and frontend (React GUI):
   ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
   
   
   4.Start the backend server:
   ```cd server```
   ```python server.py```
   
   5.Start the frontend in Crop directory
   ```npm i```
   ```npm start```
   
## Usage
- Launch the GUI by following the installation instruction.
- Input the relevant environmental and soil data.
- Click the "Predict" button to obtain crop predictions.
